# Wokwi NMEA Checksum

This repository was a sandbox for testing the usage of the Wokwi Arduino
simulator as a replacement for SimAVR for GitHub Actions CI verifying a sketch
producing NMEA checksums on the serial.

The stuff in here has been integrated into https://github.com/TomasHubelbauer/arduino-nmea.
